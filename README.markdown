# Sourcemeta JSON Schema Standard Library

***
**Browse the schemas at [https://schemas.sourcemeta.com/sourcemeta/std](https://schemas.sourcemeta.com/sourcemeta/std)**
***

Building professional OpenAPI specifications demands precision, but mastering
JSON Schema is hard. This library eliminates that burden by providing
production-ready schemas that encode industry standards and best practices.
*Reference them directly in your API specifications and focus on what matters:
designing great APIs.*

> Led and maintained by a member of the JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee

**Use this library to:**

- Build production-grade OpenAPI specifications without writing schemas from scratch
- Skip the JSON Schema learning curve while maintaining expert-level quality
- Meet compliance and regulatory requirements with standards-based validation
- Establish a solid foundation for your organisation's API governance program

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in its early stages with much more to come. We need your
> feedback to shape its future. Please [share your thoughts and

> [!NOTE]
> All schemas target JSON Schema 2020-12, the dialect used by OpenAPI v3.1 and
> later. Earlier JSON Schema dialects will be supported in the future.

## :blue_book: Standards

This library provides schemas that encode aspects of the following standards.
Note that these standards often contain concepts and specifications that cannot
be represented as schemas. We extract and formalize the portions that can be
expressed as JSON Schema definitions.

## :page_facing_up: License

While the project is publicly available on GitHub, it operates under a
[source-available license](https://github.com/sourcemeta/std/blob/main/LICENSE)
rather than a traditional open-source model. You may freely use these schemas
for non-commercial purposes, but commercial use requires a [paid commercial
license](https://www.sourcemeta.com/#pricing).

*We are happy to discuss OEM and white-label distribution options for
incorporating these schemas into commercial products*.
