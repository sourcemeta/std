Building professional OpenAPI specifications demands precision, but mastering
JSON Schema is hard. This library eliminates that burden by providing
production-ready schemas that encode industry standards and best practices.
*Reference them directly in your API specifications and focus on what matters:
designing great APIs.*

> Led and maintained by a member of the JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee

**Use this library to:**

- Build production-grade OpenAPI specifications without writing schemas from scratch
- Skip the JSON Schema learning curve while maintaining expert-level quality
- Meet compliance and regulatory requirements with standards-based validation
- Establish a solid foundation for your organisation's API governance program

> This project is in its early stages with much more to come. We need your

> [!NOTE]
> All schemas target JSON Schema 2020-12, the dialect used by OpenAPI v3.1 and
> later. Earlier JSON Schema dialects will be supported in the future.
